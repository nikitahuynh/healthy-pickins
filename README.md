# Healthy Pickin's
This project was created for SBHacks XII at the University of California, Santa Barbara.
As college students, we know the firsthand struggles of having fresh and readily accessible groceries. More often than not, we’re struggling to think of how to make healthy, affordable meals from the different produce and spices in our kitchens. We needed an innovative solution to learn new, healthy recipes given the ingredients we had on hand since nutrition is paramount to a happy college experience. With that, all the recipes in our app list its nutritional facts, including carbs, proteins, and fats.


## How to run it on your local device
1. Clone the repo
2. run ``npm install``
3. run ``npm install @supabase/supabase-js``
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Future Improvements
We want to combine computer vision and machine learning and upgrade the software such that the user can take a picture of their fridges and pantries instead of typing in everything.  
Additionally, we want to be able to further differentiate ingredients, while being able to match similar items, so that, for example: chicken and chicken thighs are categorized the same, but banana and banana peppers are not. Lastly, we want to add filters so users can sort their protein/carb amount preferences, and potentially exclude certain foods/ingredients for allergies or dietary restrictions. 
We also plan to publicly deploy our web app online using Vercel.
