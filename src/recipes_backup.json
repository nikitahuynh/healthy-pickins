      "in a large bowl , combine ground beef , bread crumbs , parsley , parmesan , 1/4 teaspoon black pepper , garlic powder and beaten egg . mix well and form into 12 balls . store , covered , in refrigerator until needed . or you can prepared the meatballs and cooked them in the oven on a sheet pan for 20 minutes at 350 f . then added them to the sauce , or store , covered , in refrigerator until needed . in a large saucepan over medium heat , saute onion and garlic in olive oil until onion is translucent . stir lean the ground beef , in tomatoes , salt , sugar and bay leaf . cover , reduce heat to low , and simmer 90 minutes . stir in tomato paste , basil , 1/2 teaspoon pepper and meatballs and simmer 30 minutes more . serve . my note , sometime i also spiced up the meatballs with some stand by italian spices and i upped the garlic . also , i used crackers in place of bread crumbs , and used a little less than called for . this made a very solid and yummy meatball i was leary of making this without first pre cooking the meatballs , but this is by far the best spaghetti and meatballs i have ever made . the meatballs ended up a nice brown color , they were not over cooked and i think putting them in before browning allowed some of the meat flavor to seep into the sauce . opted to use a combination of ground pork and ground beef instead of plain bread crumbs , i used pre seasoned breadcrumbs , i increased the parmesan cheese to 4 oz . with the sauce , instead of using 2 cans of whole tomatoes , i used 1 of whole tomatoes , and then two smaller cans of crushed tomatoes . after simmering the sauce , i ran half of it through the blender to make it smoother . i also added a small can of tomato sauce in addition to the tomato paste , plus for added flavour i added 1 tsp italian seasoning , 1/2 tsp basil , and 1 tsp garlic powder . if you think or found the meatballs too dry , may i suggest adding 1/2 cup of water , or milk , or tomato sauce to the meatballs? the eggs will bind them , but not make them moister adding liquid makes them exquisitely tender and juicy . also , if you want a lighter meatball , substitute oatmeal for the breadcrumbs measure it first , then run it briefly in the blender so you won't have any big bits in the meatballs . i added 5 tsp oregano and 3 tsp basil ",
      " added 1 tsp seasoned salt , 1 medium green pepper . i was very , very happy with the sauce . put it into a 250 oven while i cooked other stuff , for about 2 hours , it was wonderful . we do work long hours and don't have time at night to make a 2 hour meal , so what i did was use my slow cooker . in the morning i sauteed my onion and garlic , combined it with all the ingredience including half a can of tomato sauce for extra liquid since it tends to lose some in a slow cooker . had my son turn the cooker on low at his lunch , so the sauce cooked about 6 1/2 hours . one hour before the sauce was done , he put the meat balls inches we did end up adding the extra half a can of sauce just for liquid , but the flavor was amazing . by using the slow cooker for us working cooks , it was nice to come home to a ready made meal and good as this . old yes if you substituted turkey or other poultry for ground beef you are never supposed to use breadcrumbs , that type of meat is quite dry , breadcrumbs only makes it worse"

      "part 1 , . 2 cups hot water and keep it in the freezer , where it’ll stay usable for a few years , so i can use 2 tsps at a time . a package is normally about 2 3/4 teaspoons . ½ tsp barley malt . barley malt is a thick , golden liquid sugar substitute . this tiny bit will add a lovely flavor to the crust . it should be available at your local ‘health food’ store . keep it in the refrigerator so that it doesn’t grow mold , unless you end up making pizza two or three times a week , which would use up one of those little jars of barley malt before mold becomes a worry . it’s a pain to use when it’s cold . i add it to the hot water first , which gets it off the spoon and also brings down the temperature of the water a bit . 2 cups bread flour higher gluten content than regular all purpose flour . 1 tsp gluten flour , which will raise the gluten content to the right point , making the crust really chewy . also available at a ‘health food’ store . mix the water , yeast , and barley malt together . get that yeast dissolved by stirring fairly gently . use a big mixing bowl , let them sit while you get the flour and gluten flour out from wherever you keep them . you should be seeing the liquid getting a little frothy on top . add in the flours and mix well , beating them a bit for a few minutes to incorporate air . cover with a damp kitchen cotton towel rises enough to touch the towel , and let it sit out on the counter for a day . don’t refrigerate . this is a fermentation process , which develops and matures the dough , greatly enhancing the flavor . it also gives the yeast time to multiply , which is why we used so little yeast at the beginning . in fact , it will be even better if you let it sit for two days , which will make the fermentation more powerful and the dough even better tasting . if i were going to let it sit for two days rather than one i’d probably cut the yeast down to 1 teaspoons check the sponge at the end of the first day , if you’re going for two . if it looks like it’s going to bubble up to the towel , you might stir in another half cup of flour , to slow things down a bit . also , get the towel damp again if it’s dried out . part 2 , take the sponge , which should still be very wet and gooey , and stir in , mixing well , 2 tbsp olive oil . 2 tbsp salt . 2 tbsp dried basil . a couple of dashes of mrs . dash garlic un salt . it’s really nice if you have a powerful mixer . i found a kitchen aid at a second hand store and that’s what you need – if the mixer’s not built for kneading bread dough you’ll just burn it out , and doing it by hand is not so awful . people have done it and enjoyed doing it for thousands of years after all . add flour in a half cup or a cup at a time until the dough pulls away cleanly from the mixing bowl or until it’s not sticking to your hands too much . if you’re using a mixer , then mix it at medium speed for about five minutes . if you’re doing it by hand , turn out the dough onto a floured board and knead it until it feels like a baby’s ass . all those books blather about feeling silky smooth and so on , but they mean like a baby’s ass . cover with the moistened towel and let sit for about ½ hour . divide the dough into two halves and re cover one while you stretch the other . you could use a rolling pin , but that would squeeze too much gas out of the bubbles – better dough if you just stretch . i use 2 cookie sheets , and i oil them lightly with olive oil . i pull the dough until it’s about the size and shape of the sheet . i then cover it with that towel and let it rest while i work on the second half of the dough . it needs to rest about 15 minutes . this lets the gluten relax . if it doesn’t get that chance , the dough will contract for a while after you stretch it out to size . while this is happening , i oil the pans lightly with olive oil . stretching takes a bit of practice , but it’s not like you have to toss it up , spinning , in the air . i gently flatten what was a ball of dough into a disk . “gently?” well , there are some times when you take dough and slam it down on a breadboard . this is not one of them . after i get it into a rough circle of about eight to ten inches in diameter . i hold the dough with both hands , holding it about an inch in from the circumference , with my hands at about 10 , 00 and 2 , 00 , and i let the dough hang down , using its weight to stretch it . i move it around in its circle by moving my hands , bringing them together , changing grips and moving them apart . the point is to try to get the dough thinner and still maintain an even thickness . the edge remains thicker than the interior . you want that because the edge is where it’s most likely to tear , until the center starts to get pretty thin . i keep checking the size against the size of the pan i’m going to use . when it’s getting pretty close i put the dough on the pan and then turn it upside down and put it back on the pan . this puts a light coating of oil on the top side of the dough . i then stretch the dough the rest of the way , pulling along the edges to thin them down a bit . i end up with edges that are somewhat thicker than the middle portion of the pizza , but i like that . i keep a small container of water nearby , and if the dough pulls apart i very lightly moisten the edges of the hole and glue them back together . cover the crusts with that ol’ moistened towel and let rise for ½ hour or so . do what you do for topping , and put in a pre heated 475º oven until crust at edge is golden brown . i use two racks and switch the pans up and down about half way through . cooking time is about 12 minutes , usually . if you want to make it even better , go to home depot and get two 12 x 12 saltillo floor tiles . they are thick and unglazed , and you just lay one on each oven rack . they act as heat reservoirs . it will take about 45 minutes to heat the oven , and you can go through the torture of trying to bake the pizza on those tiles , but it’s just about as good to put the pans on top of the tiles . the tiles will make sure that the oven stays hot while you put the pizzas in , and they will see to it that the bottom of the pizza gets its share of the heat . it really improves the pizza , but i have to admit that i don’t bother , myself . i did it for a long time , but it got tiresome to find a place to put the tiles when they’re not in the oven , and i found myself breaking them too often , moving them around . they’re cheap enough , as opposed to the hoity toity pizza stones they sell in “gourmet” stores , which are too thin to do any good . mangia bene"

      "for the glaze , add the balsamic vinegar and worcestershire to a small saucepan and simmer over medium heat until thickened and coats the back of a spoon , 3 to 5 minutes . for the dough , preheat the oven to 500 degrees f . grease 2 baking sheets with olive oil . prepare the pizza dough according to the recipe . divide the dough into 4 equal portions . on a floured work surface , using a rolling pin , roll each piece of dough into a circle . place the circles onto the prepared baking sheets . for the toppings , place 1/4 of the ricotta , parmesan , mozzarella and tomatoes on the bottom half of each of the rounds . season the filling with salt and pepper , tear some basil leaves over the cheese and tomatoes and drizzle with a spoonful of the balsamic glaze . fold the dough rounds in half to resemble a half moon shape , covering the filling with the dough . starting at one end of the half moon , begin to fold the dough over on itself pressing down as you go . continue to fold the dough until you reach the end and then tuck the final end under and pinch it shut . brush the calzones with some more olive oil and , with the tip of a knife , make 2 slits in each calzone so the steam can escape . bake the calzones until the crust is golden and crisp , about 15 minutes . . simple pizza dough , in a liquid measuring cup , combine the warm water , yeast and sugar . allow the yeast to dissolve and bloom , about 5 minutes . once bloomed , add the olive oil . meanwhile , in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment , combine the flour and salt . stream in the water/yeast mixture and as the dough begins to come together , switch to a dough hook attachment . allow the dough to knead , adding a bit more flour if needed , so that the dough releases from the sides of the bowl , 1 to 3 minutes . you should be able to touch the dough and not have the dough stick to your fingers . once the dough has kneaded and has pulled away from the sides of the bowl , remove the dough from bowl to a floured work surface and , with floured hands , continue to knead it by hand for 1 to 2 minutes . then form the dough into a round ball and place it into a large bowl sprayed with nonstick spray . cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a clean dish towel and let the dough rise in a warm area of your kitchen until it doubles in size , 1 1/2 to 2 hours . after the dough has risen it is ready to be cooked however you'd like . tomato sauce , heat a medium saucepan to medium high . add in the olive oil . saute the onions until translucent , about 5 minutes . add in the tomatoes , garlic , sugar , red pepper flakes and season with salt and pepper . continue cooking for 10 to 15 minutes on medium low . season with salt and pepper and fold in the basil . cook's notes , cutting slits in the top of the calzone will prevent the calzone from leaking and let the steam escape . you can fill this calzone with whatever you like . this dough is wet dough , keep bench flour at the ready and make sure to flour your hands when working with the dough . trust your gut as a chef , if the dough is to wet , add more flour , if it is too stiff , add a little water . sugar is used to feed the yeast which will help the dough to grow . bread flour will give you a chewier texture because the flour has more gluten . you don't need to use a thermometer to get the water temperature , it should just feel warm to the touch ."

      "note , substitute any veggies you like , and omit any that you don't like , but avoid green veggies unless the giardiniera will be used within a couple weeks ",
      " green turns gray rapidly , though they will still taste fine . if desired , a more mellow taste can be obtained by using half distilled white vinegar and half rice vinegar or white wine vinegar . you do not want to use any colored vinegar , because they will give the veggies a dull , muddy color . if you followed the preparation directions in the ingredients section , you have already completed most of your preparation work , but there's still a little left to do . rinse any veggies that haven't been done , and spin or pat them dry , or whatever seems appropriate . place the squash and eggplant pieces in a colander , sprinkle the cut sides generously with kosher salt , and set aside for their juices to drain . bring a medium saucepan , half full of water , to a full rolling boil , and fill your sink half full of ice and water ",
      " lots of ice . drop the unpeeled pearl onions in the boiling water for 50 60 seconds to loosen their peels , and transfer to sink using a slotted spoon . when cooled , cut off the ends , squeeze gently , and the onions should just pop out . if you want to keep the different veggies separated so you can compose the jar of pickled stuff , have someone help you transfer stuff from the sink to a colander to drain , then into baggies or to small dishes as soon as cooled . otherwise , just keep dumping them into the sink , adding more ice whenever necessary . blanch the peeled garlic in boiling water for 30 seconds , then transfer to sink . repeat with mushrooms , bell peppers , daikon , radishes , green beans , carrots , banana , jalapeno , and cherry peppers , and asparagus spears . the cauliflower should be blanched for about 60 seconds , and the celery and grape tomatoes for 10 seconds each , just long enough to set their color . wash salt off squash and eggplant , and blanch them for 30 seconds , then transfer to sink just long enough to cool , then blot dry . if you have no one to help , it will just take twice as long to do the blanching stuff . if you would prefer , steam the veggies , and double all the cooking times . steaming is my preference , as it maintains more of the natural flavor . regardless of other considerations , don't let any of the veggies soak in the cold water for too long , or they will get soggy , which we don't want . they will get somewhat soggy while pickling , and we don't want them to be any worse than necessary . if desired , don't blanch anything , or blanch for 10 seconds to kill any surface critters on the veggies , but the veggies will lose color faster . some veggies will lose all color within hours , others will take longer ",
      " the bright red radishes will turn almost white , and the brilliant purple eggplants will become a pale pastel lavender color , but they still taste good . the green stuff will slowly turn grayish , which is the only reason broccoli isn't included in the recipe . to make the brine , combine distilled vinegar with all other ingredients in a medium saucepan over medium heat , and stir until everything is well combined . turn on your stove vent fan . although this stuff really smells great , it will definitely clear your sinuses when the vinegar starts to boil . reduce heat to medium low , and simmer for about 30 minutes for flavors to infuse . taste , and adjust seasonings as desired . remove from heat , and allow to cool for 20 30 minutes , but still quite hot . strain through a coarse sieve , and rinse solids in sieve thoroughly to remove most of the celery seed and other fine grained stuff , keeping most of the mustard and dill seeds and the peppercorns . be sure to incorporate some of these spices with the veggies when building the jar . while doing all this , you should have been sterilizing your canning jar . the easiest way is to run the jars and lids through the dishwasher on longest , hottest cycle , including the full drying cycle , and then put them on a towel in a 225 degree f oven so they can dry , and the heat can kill any bugs that didn't die in the dishwasher . we use 2 rubber gasket one gallon jars , but you can use smaller canning jars if desired . this will be kept in the fridge without being processed in a boilingwater bath , and it will still keep for months . rinse , dry , and stem your chives , basil , dill , and oregano , if you haven't already done so . break out the thawed artichoke hearts , and cut them into bite size piece . arrange all the other veggies on the kitchen counter if you are going to try to make the jars look pretty ",
      " otherwise , just throw everything in a giant bowl , and toss to combine . pack all the veggies into the jar fairly tightly , arranging them as desired ",
      " don't forget to insert the herbs as you go . if you end up with a few extra veggies that won't fit in the jars , throw them in a lidded plastic bowl that is just large enough to hold them ",
      " this shouldn't happen , though ",
      " ingredient amounts are pretty precise . divide the brine equally between the jars of veggies ",
      " it's probably best to use a measuring cup , one cup here , one cup there , saving a little for the leftovers if desired . top up the jars to the brim with distilled white vinegar . use a chopstick , skewer , or skinny spoon to remove air bubbles from the jars , and tap the jars on the counter to help remove bubbles , repeating a couple times . add more vinegar if necessary . wipe off the top of the jars , and seal them . after 12 hours , gently shake or roll jars , turn them upside down , and allow to set for another 12 hours at room temperature . place jars in refrigerator for 1 2 3 4 weeks to age and mellow , though they taste pretty good after just 1 2 days ",
      " it's up to you they should keep in the fridge for at least 6 months . . . probably longer . . . but the colors will get uglier , and the veggies will get mushier . they will still taste great , though ."

      "ricotta first step is to make your ricotta which seriously makes itself . it is so easy . you will need a heavy bottomed pot or strainer or colander , cheese cloth and a big bowl . step 1 , set up your colander over a large bowl . make sure there is plenty of room in the bowl for the liquid to drain . take 2 pieces of damp cheese cloth and line the colander . step 2 , in a medium to large pot , bring the milk , cream and salt to a rolling boil on medium heat stirring often . once it is boiling add in the vinegar and immediately remove from the heat and stir . the vinegar will cause the milk and cream to separate and form curds . stir a couple of times , wait 2 3 minutes , and then pour it into the strainer or colander on top of the cheese cloth . you will see the whey or clear liquid separate from the milk curds and drain to the bottom of the bowl . let it rest at room temp for about 15 20 minutes to cool before you put it in the refrigerator . just make sure as it sets in the refrigerator that none of the liquid in the bowl is touching the bottom of the ricotta . make sure to cover the ricotta with saran wrap . personally , i like to let mine set over night , but at least 4 hours to cool down and set . tomatoes i like to have these chilled rather than hot , so i make these ahead of time too . couldn't be easier . oven at 425 , line a baking sheet with aluminum foil or parchment paper and add the tomatoes . drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper . bake for approximately 10 minutes until they begin to soften , but not falling apart . let cool , transfer to a plate and cover . done herbed topping add the ricotta , lemon zest and juice , scallions , herbs , salt and pepper . mix well and set to the side . i prefer to make this right before i serve . baguettes some people bake them on a high temp in the oven , personally , i prefer to broil mine . they take only a minute or two and it is easy . i line a baking sheet with foil or parchment paper and add the baguette slices . drizzle with olive oil and broil the first side . once golden brown , flip and broil just another minute until brown . remove and rub the garlic on the side you drizzled with olive oil . that is the side you will add the toppings to . the garlic is optional , but i think it gives it a great taste . finish top each of the baguette with a little of the arugula , then a spoon of the ricotta and a tomato slice . enjoy prep time doesn't include the chilling of the ricotta ."

      "you will want to start to let your dough rise . to keep this simple and easy get frozen bread dough all ready to go , just needs to rise . you will have to plan ahead for this recipe to allow the bread dough to rise for about 4 5 hours . to start the dough rising . you remove the frozen dough and place it on a greased cookie sheet and cover with a kitchen towel . i like to spray the cookie sheet and towel with oil first so it won't stick later . try to find a warm moist place to let the dough rise . in the winter this can be hard to find . so if all you have is a cold dry place , you can do the following to get a warm moist place . in this case you will put you frozen bread dough on a greased microwavable platter and cover with kitchen towel . boil a cup of water in the microwave , then quickly remove the cup of water and put in your dough . let it sit in there for about 4 5 hours . no peeking , just let it sit . after the dough has risen , you will now need to work the dough into long rectangular pieces to make your loaves . throw some flour on your clean counter . then work the dough with your hands . you don't need to knead the dough , you just want to start spreading it out with you hands . you may have to sprinkle a little bit of flour on the dough while you are working with it . this is ok , but not too much . you will have to work with it a bit , push , pull , spread , smack , whatever it takes . you will get to a point when you will need to switch to a rolling pin to finish off the process . be careful not to spread the dough to thin , you need some thickness to handle the meat filling . i usually end up cutting a regular sized frozen bread loaf in half to make two sausage bread loaves . after the dough has been prepared and is ready for filling , you will now need to make the italian sausage and pepper filling . first , take a the two slices of bacon and cut them up into small bits with some scissors . about 1/4 peices if you can . fry up the bacon in the pan until you get a lot of nice bacon grease . now add the ground italian sausage and continue to fry . cut up 2 3 medium sized green peppers and throw them in with your sausage half way through browning . brown until the sausage gets a nice dark brown look and the peppers are well sauteed into the mix . when done , drain out all the grease , then place the meat and peppers onto a plate that has several paper towels on it to further drain the meat . let this sit long enough to cool . this would be a good time to preheat your oven to 350 degrees f . after the meat and pepper filling has cooled , you will now put this on top of the dough . spread out the filling onto the dough while leaving enough room on the sides to wrap the dough around the filling . make sure you seal all the side up well so the meat is well sealed . then with a fork , poke a bunch of holes on the top of the loaf to allow for steam venting during bakingbeat a couple of eggs into a bowl and use this as a glaze brush a little bit of egg over the loaves . this will help you get a nice golden brown look to the bread . now , place the loaves in your preheated oven and cook for 40 50 minutes . when done baking , let the loaves cool on a cookie cooling rack . for presentation , i like to slice up the loaves into small pieces and then place them on a platter like you see below . this way they are nice and easy to grab and eat . this makes a great appetizer"

      "in a small bowl , mix together the garlic salt , onion powder , sugar , oregano , pepper , thyme , basil , parsley , celery salt and regular salt . store in a tightly sealed container . to prepare dressing , whisk together 1/4 cup white vinegar , 2/3 cup canola oil , 2 tablespoons water and 2 tablespoons of the dry mix . my note , i eliminated the 2 tablespoons of salt and it was just right without it . i doubled this recipe to fill a 16 oz bottle . i used balsamic vinegar which makes this extra special . it seemed like the amount of oregano was excessive but really it is perfect once mixed and poured on the salad . this dressing mixes and tastes best when the ingredients are allowed to marry overnight in the refrigerator . finally a wonderful salad dressing that tastes as good as any in an italian restaurant we loved it update since i doubled the recipe , i used 1 tablespoon garlic salt and one tablespoon garlic powder which really gives this dressing a smooth taste with less saltiness . after making this quite a few times , adding a bit more sugar will temper down the acidic taste . i've also been adventurous and added dried , minced onion bits . to replicate the zesty good seasons mix , add 1 tablespoon dried red and green bell pepper mix plus 1 teaspoon dried red pepper flakes . also , i suggest omitting the 2 tablespoons salt . you may want to add 1 tablespoon lemon pepper to increase the zest . experiment with balsamic vinegar , fruit juices and flavored oils . side notes , blend the vinegar and 2 tablespoons mix and let sit for at least 5 minutes before proceeding with the recipe . this helps dissolve the individual spices and herbs . the water is unnecessary . you only need that with the good seasons mix , for goodness knows what chemical reaction to occur . this dressing will not stay emulsified when stored in the refrigerator . just shake it up well before use . i have used it for everything from marinading steaks to on popcorn . i think it is actually more flavorful that the packaged kind . i recently added this mix to a 50/50 blend of mayo/sour cream to make a veggie dip . it was great . i would say it would also be great for chips , or if you thin it with a little milk , it would make a great ranch dressing . i have made it several times with modifications per our taste of the day . i've used olive oil , canola , red wine vinegar , cider vinegar , balsamic and combinations of these . i have also substituted salt free seasoning for the salt . these changes all work well . substituting marjoram or savory for the thyme , celery seed for celery salt , 1/2 garlic powder for the garlic salt also works well . sometimes i add a squirt or two of spicy brown mustard when mixing in the oil & vinegar . the great thing about this recipe is it is a versatile italian season mix . i spooned out this mix into a cold pasta salad , and i spooned some into a homemade pasta sauce . when spooning out the seasoning mix , i felt that i couldn't get an even amount of the granulated seasoning and flaky seasoning . the next time i make this , i will separate items like sugar , salt , onion powder , pepper , celery salt from items like basil , oregano , parsley , thyme and spoon 1t of each ."

about five minutes , or until a cohesive dough comes together . reduce to 2 speed , and knead in machine for about 8 minutes . put about 1 cup flour into a clean mixing bowl , dredge dough lightly on both sides , tamp , and then fit into a gallon size bag to rest for 30 minutes . set the bowl of flour aside , you will need it later . make the white sauce , melt butter gently , in a 6 cup saucepan , or its equivalent . add the flour , and the salt , pepper , and seasonings . cook for about two minutes . pour in the milk , and cream , all at once , increase the heat of the pan to medium high , and stir with a whisk , while it comes to a boil . remove from heat . grate in some cheese . check for salt . remove 1/2 cup of it and cover . divide remaining sauce evenly between three bowls , that can later accommodate each vegetable separately . set aside . make the garlic butter , melt the butter in an 8 inch skillet over medium low heat , adding the garlic cloves , each crushed into a few pieces . add 2 tablespoons of the oil . simmer lazily for 5 8 minutes . remove from heat and strain into a 1 cup glass measure , or a 1 cup metal measuring cup , pressing on the garlic cloves lightly . the mixture will be divided into thirds to sauté the vegetables . the garlic cloves may sit in the butter for a while , if desired . prepare the vegetables and keep them separated , peel and slice the carrots into thin rounds , no thicker than 1/4 inch , discarding both ends . slice the zucchini exactly the same , 1/8 1/4 inch thick , discarding both ends . pull all of the flowerets off of the broccoli crown , discarding the central core . chop them fine , do this by cutting two or more slices , lengthwise down each stem of broccoli , as if beginning to dice an onion , then work the knife through it rapidly , chopping , through the flowery head , which will easily subside . sauté the vegetables , heat a 12 inch lidded sauté pan . put in two or three tablespoons of the water , the carrots , and some salt . increase the heat and add one third of the strained butter , cook , stirring often , until the carrots decrease in volume . cover the pan , lower the heat , checking from time to time , and cook for about 8 minutes . the carrots should be fully cooked , and offer minimal resistance to the tooth , they should not be al dente , and will not continue to cook , in the lasagna . place the carrots , and all the contents of the pan , into one of the bowls containing the white sauce , stir well , cover , and set aside . return the pan to medium heat . put in half of the remaining butter , and the zucchini , season with salt , and increase the heat , if desired . stir often , separating the zucchini rounds as necessary , when a fond develops on the bottom of the pan , add two tablespoons of the water , to deglaze , cook the zucchini , just until they are done , they will cook faster than the other two vegetable , if they stick together , separate pieces with a dinner knife and fork . pour them into the second bowl of béchamel , stir , cover and set aside . return the pan to medium heat . add the remaining butter and the remaining oil and slip in the broccoli , some salt , and the remaining two or three tablespoons of water . cover the pan , and cook for a few minutes . remove the lid , increase the heat , and simmer for a few minutes to evaporate any moisture . the broccoli should be fully cooked . turn into the past pot of béchamel , stir , cover , and set aside . get a pot of water boiling with salt in it . roll the pasta , fit the mixer with the pasta rolling attachment . retrieve the pasta and cut into eight equal pieces . retrieve the bowl of flour . sprinkle some lightly on a clean sheet pan . keep the bowl handy . run each piece of pasta dough through on the largest setting . dredge each side of dough into flour as it comes from the machine , so that they can set together without sticking . run the pasta through again on the next largest setting . do not keep dredging in flour unless it seems sticky , but it probably won't . run each pasta sheet through the machine , until reaching a setting of 5 , or at most , 6 , not more , or the cooking method will have to be changed . do not trim the pasta . blanch each piece of pasta in the simmering water for , in two batches , for about two or at most three minutes , it is possible that it could take less . the pasta should be very al dente , but edible . retrieve with a pair of tongs lightly into a sieve , set over a bowl , run cold water over it continually , until it is not hot anymore . have a large mixing bowl or basin handy , where they can be collected , after being retrieved from the running water . do not dry them . do this with all pasta sheets , it is okay to work in small batches , as long as you feel comfortable in the cooking process . do not overcook them . grease a rather deep 13x9 inch pan with a tablespoon of shortening , or softened butter . put 1 pasta sheet into the pan . add another , overlapping by no more than 1 inch . use the sharpest , rather small knife that you can get , a paring knife or fillet knife will do . trim the edges and sides up the pasta , allowing it to travel about 1/2 1 inch up the sides of the pan , so that it builds up a nice edge , and also a barrier for the filling to rest inches add one of the fillings , smooth the filling , then grate over parmesan . do the same procedure to the pasta and filling for each layer , i press the pasta on the previously laid filling before adding the next . there will be pasta left over . if preferred , the filling can be laid , before the pasta is trimmed around the edge . lay on and cut the final layers of pasta , being cautious that it does not expose the filling from underneath . spread the reserved 1/2 cup sauce evenly and dot with a thick layer of cheese . it is a good idea to grate the cheese all at once into a bowl before doing this because some of it will inevitably fall out of the pan if using a grater directly over the filling . you don't have to . bake the lasagna uncovered on the middle level of a heated 375 degree oven for 25 or 28 minutes . remove . preheat the broiler . glaze for two or three minutes . rest"

      "begin by cutting the peeled eggplants in half , length wise . with a spoon , scrape out the bulk of the seeds , if the eggplant is too seedy – these only tend to bitter the eggplant ",
      " be careful not to take too much of the eggplant off . cut the halves into ½ inch slices , salt both sides with coarse salt and place the slices into a colander to drain for approximately 1 ½ to 2 hours . you can place a heavy pan on top to quicken the draining . after draining , wash the slices in cold water and pat each slice thoroughly dry . you can omit this salting step , but the drained eggplant is of much better quality for frying and salting and draining is highly recommended . cut the eggplant slices into ½ inch to ¾ inch cubes and set aside . to blanch the roma or plum tomatoes , boil water in a small open pot . remove from heat . carefully score the top of each tomato with an x and drop a tomato or two in the hot water . with a spoon , push the tomatoes under the hot water for 15 30 seconds . remove and place the tomatoes in a bowl of ice water and let sit . when all the tomatoes have been blanched and are resting in ice water , the skins should begin to peel back . proceed to peel the skin from the tomatoes , starting at the top where the tomato was scored . peel with a small paring knife . place all the peeled tomatoes in a bowl , cut into chunks and set aside . cut the peeled celery ribs into strips and chop into ½ inch pieces . blanch the celery pieces in boiling water for 2 3 minutes and drain . sauté the celery pieces in a few tablespoons of olive oil , drain and set aside . in a large skillet , place enough canola oil to cover the pan’s bottom ¼ inch deep . heat the oil , and place the well drained eggplant pieces one layer deep into the pan and fry until soft . remove from pan and drain on paper towels to remove excess oil . repeat until all the eggplant is fried and drained . in a pan large enough to hold all your ingredients , sauté the onions in a few tablespoons of olive oil until they are translucent , being careful not to brown them . next add the capers , the the green pitted olives and the 1 and 1/2 cups of the marinara sauce , the roma or plum tomatoes and continue to cook over low heat for 15 30 minutes until the mixture reduces and thickens and the roma tomato chunks are cooked into the mixture , but still distinguishable . stir the mixture from time to time to prevent sticking . you will need to use your judgment to determine the doneness of the mixture , but do not overcook , a little less is better . the mixture should not be dry . note , you may also use one 28oz . can of whole plum shaped tomatoes , well drained , seeded and cut into medium size pieces in place of the roma plum tomatoes above . add the fried eggplant pieces , the sautéed celery pieces and chopped basil to the tomato mixture and continue to cook over low heat for several minutes , stirring the mixture to prevent the mixture from sticking . do not overcook and let the mixture become too dry . it is best if it is thick and loose . when the tomato mixture appears to be absorbed into the eggplant , add the wine vinegar , stirring the hot mixture continually . a word to the wise , stand away from the pan when adding the wine vinegar to the hot mixture to prevent inhaling the vinegar vapor . add the sugar , a bit at a time , stirring between additions to speed absorption . note , i have found it best to add half the wine vinegar and the sugar . taste to assure the correct degree of sweetness and sourness before continuing with either of these two ingredients . this is a matter of personal taste . salt and pepper may be added to taste at this point also , but remember that several of the ingredients were soaked in brine , so be careful with the salt cool the caponata well before serving . the caponata may be placed into a container and refrigerated . this is one of those dishes that ages well and the taste even improves over time . it will keep for several days in a refrigerator ",
      " just stir the mixture well from time to time . i recommend cooking this dish in advance to take full advantage of these qualities . an added tip , this dish also freezes well , just place in an appropriate container and freeze , let thaw and stir before serving . remember to always serve at room temperature . caponata can be served as an antipasto or appetizer . it is delicious served on bruschetta or with pieces of crusty italian bread . there should be enough to serve at least"
